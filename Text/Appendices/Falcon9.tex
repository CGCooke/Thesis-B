\chapter{Falcon 9 v1.1 flight performance}

In order to develop relevant solutions to  problems in industry, it is important to have an understanding of what the real world challenges faced by the receiver are. A thorough understanding of the real world challenges allows accurate simulations analysis to be carried out.

In order to meet this goal, the Falcon 9 v1.1 was chosen for analysis. There were a number of reasons for this choice, in particular, the Falcon 9 is gaining industry acceptance, and is likely to represent a significant market share of launches going forward. Additionally, Space Exploration Technology Corporation (SpaceX) who develop,construct and launch the Falcon 9 are more open regarding the technical details of their \ac{LV} than their contemporaries. Finally, the Falcon 9 v1.1 is experiences a wide variety of dynamics, including the first stage conducting a "hover slam" or "suicide burn" manoeuvre, the success of which is reliant on accurate position and velocity estimates.

Because the actual flight performance of the Falcon 9 v1.1 is proprietary and confidential, an effort must be made to develop an model which uses publicly disclosed information. In this manner, a model of the performance can be developed, and compared against real world performance of the \ac{LV}.

\section{Measured performance}

In order to verify the physics model, it must be compared against real world data. Because the true flight performance is proprietary and confidential, the publicly released videos and associated commentary of three different launches were transcribed.

\section{Velocity requirements}
The 2nd stage burn must be terminated at precisely the right time, to ensure that the final velocity is correct. This is because the orbital height is dictated by the velocity, 

\begin{equation}
v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{align*}
G &= 6.673 \times 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}\\
M &= 5.972 \times 10^{24} kg
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{G \cdot M}{v_0^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{dr}{dv} = \frac{-2 \cdot G \cdot M}{v_0^3}
\end{equation}

For \ac{LEO}, with an orbital velocity of $\approx$ 7,800 m/s, this results in a a differential of 1,679m of altitude, per m/s of velocity. Given that SpaceX guarantees orbital height of $\pm$ 10km, this results in a velocity tolerance of $\pm$ 5.95 m/s, or $\pm$ 31.2 Hz of doppler shift.

\section{Launch azimuth}

\begin{equation}
\beta = arcsin \Big(\frac{cos(i)}{cos(\phi)}\Big)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{align*}
 i &= \text{Orbit inclination}\\
 \phi &= \text{Launch site latitude}\\
 \beta &= \text{Launch azimuth}\\
\end{align*}

\cite{LaunchDesign}

The \ac{ISS} has an inclination of $51.6\degree$, hence a launch from Cape Canaveral ($\phi = 28.5\degree$), $\beta=44.9\degree$.

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) is attempting to reduce launch costs by recovering the first stage of their Falcon 9-R launch vehicle. After first stage separation, the first stage performs a burn-back procedure, to fly back to the launch pad. During the burn-back, there is an inferred maximum de-acceleration of $\approx 7.8 g$ during the hypersonic burn, based on published performance figures. An overview of the flight profile can be found in figure \ref{fig:Falcon9Profile}. Additional information regarding the Falcon 9 V1.1 can be found in appendix \ref{ch:Falcon9}.

Thinking out aloud : 
So each engine uses 240Kg/s of fuel,
At 100\% thrust, each engine develops 66.73 tons of thrust.
Empty first stage is 25.6 Tons,

Because each engine can only be throttled to 70\%, or 46.5 tons of thrust, then the rocket is actually trying to accelerate upwards at 1.8G when empty (Or just before landing), which is why it's non trivial!

The first stage initially has 396 tons of fuel, I have no idea how much is needed to return the first stage, lets guesimate 10\%.

I think the most efficient burn is going to be all 9 engines, at 100\% thrust, 
With a vehicle mass of 39.6T propellant + 25.6 Tons, there is a total mass of 65.2 tons.
So the 1st stage will commence the burn back with an acceleration of 9.2G, The maximum possible acceleration is 23.5G, at zero fuel.

I think that's where the higher G numbers come from,
