\chapter{Simulator Jitter}

\section{Context}
During the testing of the NAMURU reciever, issues with the performance were identified. During thesting, the reciever was failing to sustain pahselock, resulting in an inability to track the signal. By conducting a thorough investigation using the KeaDebug feature, the source of the excessive phase error was uncovered, and the problem was rectified. 

\section{Investigation}

Upone examining the signal generated by the simulator, a discrete, quantized pattern became evident in the frequency output. This pattern, an example of which can be seen in \ref{fig:Stepping} resulted in excessive acceleration and jerk on a periodic basis, as opposed to constant acceleration, with zero jerk. Given the type 3 tracking loops in the reciever are sensitive to jerk, the root cause of the excessive phase error had been identified. By refering to the associated manuals for the GNSS simulators owned by the school, WRITE MORE STUFF HHERE
