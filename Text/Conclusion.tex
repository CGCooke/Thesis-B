\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

In conclusion, the primary goals of the thesis have been met, with the development of a new control algorithm that is quantifiable superior to the current control algorithm, in terms of both robustness and accuracy. The performance has been measured both using software and hardward simulations, and is correlated with the underlying theory. 

Additionally, other goals that was specified in Thesis A have also beem met, these include :

\begin{itemize}
\item{Extending the software model to take into account jitter and lags}
\item{Validate the model against the existing receiver.}
\item{Use a Monte Carlo simulation of the receiver to perform a parametric study of the receiver.}
\end{itemize}

Some goals of the initial thesis were unable to be met, specifically modelling the effects of vibration on the crystal phase jitter using the sotware model. However, an analytical solution was discovered in the liturature, which was use to achieve the same aim.
