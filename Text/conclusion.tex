\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

In conclusion, the primary goals of the thesis have been met, with the development of a new control algorithm that is quantifiable superior to the current control algorithm, in terms of both robustness and accuracy. 

All of the tasks identified in the Thesis part A were achieved, specifically : 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Extending the software model to take into account jitter and lags}
\item{Extending the software model to take into account the effect of dynamics on the crystal}
\item{Validate the model against the existing receiver}
\item{Use a Monte Carlo simulation of the receiver to perform a parametric study of the receiver}
\item{Implementation of an improved algorithm on the \ac{NAMURU} Receiver}
\end{itemize}
