There is possibly something very wrong with the t factor.




Rework conclusion
Move stuff from myworkThesisA to Namuru
Put in an example for re-entry

To underscore the importance of an accurate velocity estimate, The nominal rate per kg to transport cargo to \ac{LEO} is \$5,000USD. The Falcon9 V1.1 second stage engine burns $\approx 250 kg/s$ of fuel per second. Every m/s error in the engine cutoff, results the burn being extended for 20ms. Assuming that an equal mass of fuel is required to correct the orbit, this results in \$50,000 worth of lost cargo revenue.

Every second of additional burn during the hover-slam procedure is worth \$875,000USD in terms of lost cargo revenue.
